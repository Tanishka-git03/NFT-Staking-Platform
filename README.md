# NFT Staking Platform

## Project Description

The NFT Staking Platform is a decentralized application built on Ethereum that allows users to stake their Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to earn ERC20 token rewards over time. This platform creates a bridge between NFT ownership and DeFi yield farming, enabling NFT holders to generate passive income from their digital assets without selling them.

The platform supports multiple whitelisted NFT collections and distributes rewards based on the duration and quantity of staked NFTs. Users maintain ownership of their NFTs while earning rewards, and can unstake at any time to retrieve their original assets plus accumulated rewards.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a comprehensive ecosystem that maximizes the utility of NFTs beyond just collectibles and art. By enabling NFT staking, we aim to:

- **Enhance NFT Utility**: Transform static NFT holdings into yield-generating assets
- **Build Community Engagement**: Encourage long-term holding and community participation
- **Bridge NFT and DeFi**: Create seamless integration between NFT ownership and decentralized finance
- **Democratize Rewards**: Provide equal earning opportunities for all NFT holders regardless of collection size
- **Foster Innovation**: Establish a foundation for more advanced NFT-based financial products

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Collection Support**: Stake NFTs from various whitelisted collections
- **Flexible Staking**: Stake and unstake NFTs at any time without lock-up periods

- **Real-time Calculations**: View pending rewards in real-time before claiming

### Security & Governance
- **Smart Contract Security**: Built with OpenZeppelin's battle-tested contracts
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevents common attack vectors with ReentrancyGuard
- **Owner Controls**: Administrative functions for platform management
- **Whitelist System**: Curated NFT collections to ensure quality and security

### User Experience

- **Rental System**: Allow staked NFTs to be rented out for additional income streams

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion
- **NFT Lending**: Use staked NFTs as collateral for loans
- **Fractional Ownership**: Enable partial ownership of high-value NFTs through staking
- **Yield Farming**: Integrate with other DeFi protocols for compound yield opportunities
- **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile application for easier access and management

### Phase 4: Community & Partnerships
